students and recording tomorrow.

them.

4. Refactored and fixed labeling code, noticed some formatting errors with how I was recording data.

5. Started writing code to visualize the data to check if the data is
correct

July 1:
1. Finished the visualization for the audio.

so I dont have to manually do these processes.
