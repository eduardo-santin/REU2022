June 30:
1.Recorded some more data for the dataset 
(only counting here the ones that made it to the dataset folder)
Sitting:10
Walking: 10
Standing: 10
Stairs: 5 

2. Got 1 student to record, there was a mixup with the accelerometer data
for the first student, so I decided not to include the data. Will try again for more
students and recording tomorrow.


3. They were many duplicates recordings in the dataset folder, delete
them.

4. Refactored and fixed labeling code, noticed some formatting errors with how I was recording data.

5. Started writing code to visualize the data to check if the data is
correct
