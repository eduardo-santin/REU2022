June 30:
1.Recorded some more data for the dataset 
(only counting here the ones that made it to the dataset folder)
Sitting:10
Walking: 10
Standing: 10
Stairs: 5 

2. Got 1 student to record, there was a mixup with the accelerometer data
for the first student, so I decided not to include the data. Will try again for more
students and recording tomorrow.


3. They were many duplicates recordings in the dataset folder, delete
them.

4. Refactored and fixed labeling code, noticed some formatting errors with how I was recording data.

5. Started writing code to visualize the data to check if the data is
correct

July 1:
1. Finished the visualization for the audio.
2. Fixed some labeling errors and made some functions to help with detecting empty files, 
deleting duplicates and separating the data from csv and audio files for better readability for me and
so I dont have to manually do these processes.
3. Read 3/3 papers sent


July 6:
1.Read and started summary for paper
2.Reviewing how to apply collected data to the deep learning model used in tutorial

July 7.
1.Read papers and started searching for github repos with raw audio input data for deep network

July 8.
1. Read paper Dr.Roy suggested
2. Researching how to modify our data to fit the pytorch model from tutorial.

July 11.
1. Finished data visualization for the csv data of the recording,
changed unix timestamps to recorded time in seconds.
2. Converted all 3gpp data files to wav, needed for the visualization and propbably useful for future use
3. Started revising some research papers to better understand and revise.

July 12 - 15
1. Audio Set dataset
2. Made scripts to decode the labels and to assign each decoded label name to each item in the dataset.
3. Started going through sample clips of the dataset to assign which samples included repetitive hand movement, if they had speech.
