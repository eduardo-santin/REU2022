Esense 3gpp file sample rate: 44100 Hz
Sample rate in the java code: 50 #assuming its 50Hz


Paper from week summary meeting:
AmicroN: Framework for Generating Micro-Activity Annotations for
Human Activity Recognition 
(short paper), 
Soumyajit Chatterjee and Bivas Mitra (IIT Kharagpur, India); 
Sandip Chakraborty (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India)


The timestamps for the esense recordings are recorded in unix time, millisecond format.
